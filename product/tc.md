Terms of Service
================

Last Updated: February 26th, 2020

‍

Welcome to Askdata! These Terms of Service (the "Terms") and our Privacy Policy govern your access to and use of the Askdata services and the Askdata website, including any browser extensions, mobile applications and other downloadable apps we provide (collectively, "Askdata"), so please read them carefully.

By using Askdata, you are agreeing to these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use Askdata. If you are using Askdata on behalf of an organization such as your employer, you are agreeing to these Terms on behalf of that organization, and represent and warrant that you have the authority to agree to these terms on the organization's behalf. In that case, "you" and "your" will refer to that organization.

We may periodically revise the Terms. If a revision is material, as determined solely by us, we will notify you for example via email. The current version of our Terms will always be posted on our Terms page, so please check back regularly. By continuing to use Askdata after revisions become effective, you are agreeing to the revised Terms. If you do not agree to the revised Terms, please stop using Askdata.

Your Askdata Account To use Askdata, you'll need to create an account, either via Askdata or through a third-party service such as Google. In the latter case, personal information you provided to that third party, such as your name, email address and other information your privacy settings on that service allow us to access, will be used to create your Askdata account.

You are responsible for safeguarding your Askdata login credentials. You are responsible for activity on your account, whether or not you authorized that activity. You should immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your account.

Your Content By using Askdata, you provide us with text, images, file attachments, and other information ("your content"). You retain full ownership of your content - what belongs to you stays yours.

You can remove your content by deleting it. However, in certain instances, some of your content may not be completely removed (when your data is shared with someone else, for example). We are not responsible or liable for the removal or deletion of any of your content, or the failure to remove or delete such content.

You are solely responsible for your content and indicate that you own or have the necessary rights to all of your content, and that use of your content does not infringe, misappropriate or violate a third party's intellectual property rights, or rights of publicity or privacy, or result in the violation of any applicable law or regulation.

Your Use of Askdata
===================

Askdata is owned by Innaas srl and its licensors and is protected by United States and international copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret and other intellectual property or proprietary rights laws.

You may only use Askdata as permitted by law, including all applicable federal, state, local or international laws and regulations. Do not, for example:

Confidentiality
===============

Confidential Information. From time to time, either party (the "Disclosing Party") may disclose or make available to the other party (the "Receiving Party") non-public, proprietary, and confidential information of the Disclosing Party ("Confidential Information"). Confidential Information includes any information that reasonably should be understood to be confidential given the nature of the information and the circumstances of disclosure, including non-public business, product, technology and marketing information ("Confidential Information"). Confidential Information does not include any information that: (a) is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of the Receiving Party's breach of this confidentiality section; (b) is or becomes available to the Receiving Party on a non-confidential basis from a third party source, provided that such third party is not and was not prohibited from disclosing such Confidential Information; (c) was in the Receiving Party's possession prior to the Disclosing Party's disclosure hereunder; or (d) was or is independently developed by the Receiving Party without using any of the Disclosing Party Confidential Information.

Protection and Use of Confidential Information. The Receiving Party shall: (a) protect and safeguard the confidentiality of the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information with at least the same degree of care as the Receiving Party would protect its own Confidential Information, but in no event with less than a commercially reasonable degree of care; (b) not use the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information, or permit it to be accessed or used, for any purpose other than to exercise its rights or perform its obligations under these Terms; and (c) not disclose any such Confidential Information to any person or entity, except to the Receiving Party's service providers or financial/legal advisors who need to know the Confidential Information and are bound to confidentiality obligations at least as restrictive as those in these Terms.

Compelled Access or Disclosure. If the Receiving Party is required by applicable law or legal process to disclose any Confidential Information, it shall, prior to making such disclosure, use commercially reasonable efforts to notify the Disclosing Party of such requirements to afford the Disclosing Party the opportunity to seek, at the Disclosing Party's sole cost and expense, a protective order or other remedy.
