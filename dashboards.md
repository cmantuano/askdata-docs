#### Askdata makes Dashboard management more effective by simplifying interaction with data in all these aspects. 

We move from a Data Visualization to a Data Experience. 

We focus on the meaning of the data and user experience so the user can take its value in a simple and intuitive way at a glance. 

This not only increases user adoption of BI and analytics within organizations (ROI) but increases user engagement with data.

#### Immediate impact on:

        <p class="card-text">E2E Dashboard implementation cost is generally high due to big number of IT & business resources involved and initially high CAPEX. High OPEX cost (license, Support & DevOps) and always growing contingency cost due to business processes changes.</p>
