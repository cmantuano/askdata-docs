A Data Card is the simplest piece of content that can be exchanged on Askdata and it must be necessarily associated with a feed. <br/>
In order to create a Card, we can proceed in two ways:

## Create it from Agent's Home 

If you have already created a feed, you can generate a new card by clicking **Create** and then **Data Card**:

<p align="center" >
  <img src="media/create_card_from_agent.PNG" width="650" />
</p>

Then you will be asked to enter the name and to select the feed to associate the card with (you can also create a new feed from this page). 


<p align="center">
  <img src="media/data_card_info.PNG" width="650" />
</p>

When you are done just click **Add** and you are good to go!

## Create it from a feed

If you have already [created a feed](https://docs.askdata.com/docs/be-productive-with-feeds.html), you can simply add a new card by clicking **New Data Card** and customize it with your name.

<p align="center">
  <img src="media/data_card_from_feed.PNG" />
</p>

When you are done just click **Add** and you are good to go!

# Customize your data card

Once you have created a Data card by using one of the available methods, we offer the possibility to highly customize it according to your style and to your requirements. With Askdata you can create different types of content within a Data Card, matching your needs with extreme neatness and enhancing your data experience. <br/>
</br>
When you enter a card that has just been created, you will be presented two sections by default:
* Data Card header
* Natural Language query
<p align="center">
  <img src="media/card_landing.PNG" />
</p>


If you click on a specific section, a tab on the right will be shown and you will be able to set all the desired properties. Now we are going to dive deeper in the two sections mentioned above.

## Data card header

The data card header allows you to change some of the default settings of the card. You are able to customize it:

* **Data Card Title**: Title of your data card that will be shown in the feed
* **Data Card Slug**: Slug used by our system, mustn't contain any space
* **Icon**: We offer a wide variety of icons available but you can also upload one from your device

When you are done customizing the settings click save and the system will update. This applies for all the components, **you must click save to show the updated resources**.

<p align="center">
  <img src="media/card_settings.PNG" />
</p>

## Natural Language query

This is the component where the real power of Askdata shows up. If you click on the **Edit** button you will be prompted to enter the query in natural language. After hitting **Run** your results will be quickly shown together with the **recognized entities** and some suggestions on some **other possible interpretations** of your query.

<p align="center">
  <img src="media/nl_query.png" />
</p>

To save your NL query, just hit **Done** in the upper right corner or cancel if you want to discard it. </br>
## Other components
Now we are going to present all the different components that can be added to a data card in order to customize it:

<p align="center">
  <img src="media/components_list.PNG" />
</p>


# Query

# Search

For every component you have to possibility to **delete** it using the bin icon just on the right hand side of the component and to move it up/down on the card using the arrows on the left hand side.

## Saving the data card

When finished customizing the card, you can have a preview of it hitting the **Preview** button.
<p align="center">
  <img src="media/preview_done.PNG" />
</p>

At this point you can either **Duplicate** it (i.e. copy it in another feed) or click **Done** to finish the process.
