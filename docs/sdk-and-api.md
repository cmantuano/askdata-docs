The Askdata SDK is a collection of programming tools, utilities, documentation, and libraries of functions or classes that are designed to allow users to customize and extend Askdata products and to integrate them within other applications. The programming tools provided by the Askdata SDK— including programming instructions, points of access, and guidelines for developers— allow programmers to enhance the operation of their software by customizing and embedding the robust functionality of the Askdata platform. 

The Askdata SDK provides access to the entire MicroStrategy platform and includes all of the services and utilities required for building a robust, feature-filled business intelligence-enabled application. The Askdata SDK is made up of the following individual SDKs:
