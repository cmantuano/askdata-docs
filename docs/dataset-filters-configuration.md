## Dataset: Rules

This document provides examples of advanced dataset configuration deploying a business logic rule to a dataset

### Sorting rules

In this example, we provide the instructions for sorting the results of the query
```javascript
[
{
   "when" : "!query.isSorted()",
   "order" : "PRICE" 
},
{
   "when" : "!query.isSortedByMeasure()",
   "order" : "PRICE ASC" 
},
{
   "when" : "!query.isSortedByDimension()",
   "order" : "PLACE DESC" 
},
{
   "when" : "!query.isSortedBy('place')",
   "order" : "PRICE DESC, PLACE ASC" 
},
{
   "when" : "query.hasAnyEntity('YEAR')", 
   "order" : "YEAR DESC" 
}
]
```
### Filters

Filters are powerful tools that can be used to restrict access to some data. For example if you are a manager in a company and would like one of your employees to access just the data that is related to himself, you could achieve that by defining a simple filter as in the picture:

<p align="center">
  <img src="media/filters-example.PNG" width="650" />
</p>

```javascript
[
{
   "when": "user.details.division",
   "then": "CUSTOMER_DIVISION = '{{user.details.division}}' OR CUSTOMER_REGION = '{{user.details.region}}'",
   "type" : "EXPR" 
}
]
```

For example in the above use case we are specifying that if the user login email is *employee@yourcompany.com* then just show him the records where *name=John* and *surname=Doe*. This obviously is a rather simple example of the definition of a filter, more complex ones can be build in order to guarantee the proper flexibility to your dataset. If you would like to have a deeper overview of filters you can watch (this resource)[filters]

**Example with user defined security:**

This is an example of an advanced filter that could be applied to the dataset.

```javascript

[
    {
        "when": "(user.username == "myuser@mymail.com2") && (user.details.user_type != null)",
        "then": "CASE WHEN '{{user.details.user_type}}' <> 'DIR' THEN AGENZIA IN ( SELECT agenzia_cod FROM VIEW_USERS WHERE user_id = '{{user.details.custom_id}}') WHEN '{{user.details.user_type}}' = 'DIR' THEN 1=1 ELSE 1 <> 1 END"
    }
]

```

This filter is triggered when the conditions specified in the when clause are met.

**Example with default time filter taking the highest year available as default **

This is an example of an advanced filter that is applied to the dataset to automatically filter by the latest available year - when not specified in the user query

```javascript


[
    {
        "when": "!query.hasAnyEntity('year')",
        "then": "\"YEAR\" = (SELECT MAX(YEAR) FROM NAME_OF_MY_TABLE )",
        "type": "EXPR"
    }
]

```
