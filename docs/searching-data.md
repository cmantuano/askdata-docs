Askdata serves for a data search. Users can query data at any time through the search bar.

When you are typing the query system provides useful suggestions like most frequent queries similar to the ones you are writing (drop-down menu) and the autocomplete of the query with the data objects the system is aware of. Use your own query or suggestions below and click **Search**.
