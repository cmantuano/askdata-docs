#### Effect "Askdata" 

Askdata makes Dashboard management more effective by simplifying interaction with data in all these aspects. 

We move from a Data Visualization to a Data Experience. 

We focus on the meaning of the data and user experience so the user can take its value in a simple and intuitive way at a glance. 

This not only increases user adoption of BI and analytics within organizations (ROI) but increases user engagement with data.

#### Immediate impact on:
